# HEXplorer
HEXplorer is a A2L and HEX/SREC file parser and editor.
It allows you to edit, modify and save calibration files used for example in automotive into Engine Control Units.

Project with Qt6 framework starts from 1.0.0.

Important remark: 
- The a2l lexer and parser are fully written from scratch without any external libraries except Qt when needed.
- For performance goals, HEXplorer embeds QScintilla library as a text editor and Qwt as a 2D plot framework.
- all the keywords possibly used into a A2L file from ASAM2 are not yet implemented.
- if you kindly tell me which you need I can support if the win/win cooperation is respected!
- then for BUGS which might occur, please use the issues reporting to get supported.
